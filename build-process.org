#+TITLE: Developer Guide - How to Build the Lab?

* How to build the lab?

The sources of the lab are stored in the svn repository. The =php=
folder has all the scripts for the authentication and testing of the
uploaded files. The =experiment= folder has the entire content for the
lab including the experiments, objectives of the lab, quizzes and
instructions on how to use the lab. Any change done to these files would
be automatically incorporated in the build. The =makefile= exists in the
=src= folder. It provides us with the option of making a build using the
command =make all=. =make run-local= builds the lab on the localhost to
enable the testing of the lab without hosting it on the =test server=. 


* Server Side Dependencies
 - PHP : =php5-ldap=
 - Apache Web Server : =libapache2-mod-php5=
 - LDAP : =ldap-utils= and =ldapscripts=

These are the packages needed to run the lab successfully on the local
machine or on the server side.
