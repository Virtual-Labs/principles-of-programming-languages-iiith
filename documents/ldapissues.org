#+TITLE: LDAP Errors and Solutions

* Error: Could not guess User

In the file /usr/share/ldapscripts/runtime, the line USER=$(logname
2>/dev/null) should be changed to USER=`id -nu`. It shows the current
user of the script.

* Error: Could not resolve vlusers to gid

The files in /etc/ldapscripts/ have to edited. 

- ldapscripts.conf : The server, suffix, gsuffix, usuffix, binddn
  should all be changed properly.
- ldapscripts.passwd : The correct password should be given. Instead
  of editing the file directly, use the following command: 
echo -n "password" > /etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.passwd

Also, the ldapscripts.passwd should be readable only by the owner and
the group and the group owner of the file should be www-data.

* Error: ldapscripts.log is not writebale

The file /var/log/ldapscripts.log should have group ownership of
www-data and should have write permissions as well.
