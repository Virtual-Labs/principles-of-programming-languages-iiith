Building the tgz file
----------------------

  
     make -k all login=<your-login-on-pascal>

This command does the following:
 
  0. Deletes the directory /tmp/popl.

  1. Checks out a fresh copy of the popl-vlab/code directory into /tmp/popl/code.

  2. Builds the time-stamped .tgz file into /tmp/popl/build/<filename>.tgz.


Exporting the file the server
-----------------------------

  make -k export

This command

  scp's to pascal and installs the tgz in /var/www.  You
  need sudo access on pascal for this to work.
