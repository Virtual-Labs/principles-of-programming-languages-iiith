How to install and run POPL-VLABS 


* Installing PHP 
We have been using PHP 5.3.  5.2 should also work.

  sudo apt-get install php5

* Install mod-php5

  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
  

* Installing Racket

  - Install the latest version of Racket in the default
    location by downloading the installation from the
    website (rather than apt-get install, which might give
    you the old version).

  - set the variable RACKET_HOME to point to the
    installation directory of Racket.


* Installing Scribble inside Racket

  - Scribble should be available by default in the racket
    distribution in the location

      $RACKET_HOME/bin/scribble

* Installing Python

  - Install version 2.6 (not 3.0) 

    sudo apt-get install python2.6

* Make the build

  - Run  the makefile in the popl-vlab/src directory

* Export the build to the server

  - Remote copy the build directory to /var/www/

  - Set the permissions of build to 755

  - ensure that build/usr and build/tmp are globally
    writable

* Access the lab url

  - http://localhost/build/index.html
